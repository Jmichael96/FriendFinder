## About 
This application is used to meet new friends by answering a quick survey, and 
matching you with someone else with the closest answers to yours!
A server is used to take in the information and display it in a modal after you complete your survey.
After a user submits their information it is stored in a json file with the rest of the users' data.
If a users information and score from the survey is relatively close to another users they will be notified
who it is they matched with.
The name and picture of the user that is being matched will all be in the modal for the user to see.
